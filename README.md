# Nand2Tetris
Implementation of a basic 16 bit computer
This Project is created from basic NAND gates to achieve the functionality of 16 bit computer.
It is created in various phases. From creating the elementory logic gates to RAM, ROM, ALU and then assembling them to create a fully functional 16 bit hardware.
Then the remaining phases include the creation of software based heirarchy. i.e. VM Traslator for converting the stack based virtual machine.
OS which will be used to execute the codes.
Jack language: It is high level programming language that will be used to write programs of OS.
